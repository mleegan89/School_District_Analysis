# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis we were tasked to complete by Maria was to determine the effect that a potential cheating scandal in the ninth grade at Thomas High School had on the results. In order to accurately conduct this analysis we wanted to remove the data that was from all ninth grade students at Thomas High School and than report on that data. 

## Results

- How is the district summary affected?

Because of the small amount of data that the 9th graders from this school represented out of almost 40,000 students there was little impact to the district summary numbers.

- How is the school summary affected?
The overall student summary is not affected by the removal of these ninth grades scores. All of the other schools data and performances remain unchanged. 

- How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

When we look at just Thomas High School and we include the 9th grade that cheated we can see that the performance greatly decreases. This is because we are including all ninth graders and assigning them a score of 0 which skews the data.

When we remove all of the ninth graders data the results go on to show Thomas High School as being among of the top 5 schools. 

How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
 - Math and reading scores:

## Summary

The only thing affected was the "Average Math Sore", "Average Reading Score", "% Percent Math", and "% Passing Reading" for Thomas High School's data.
